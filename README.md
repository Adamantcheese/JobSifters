Scrapes job postings for Microsoft, Cisco, or Amazon and applies additional keyword filtering to the URL and job description and requirements. Senior level jobs generally don't apply to me (at the time of this repository being made) and I don't really need them in the search results. 

Uses Selenium for scraping because I couldn't use a normal web scraper to do this because the websites are weird.
